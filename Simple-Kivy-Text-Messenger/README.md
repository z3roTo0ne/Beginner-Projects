This Simple Kivy Text Messenger can be used to send text messages to someone who also has this script running on their device. It uses IP addresses to exchange messages. This kivy script is experimental and may have a lot of bugs. It uses sockets to communicate via the IPV4 Protocol. User A has to listen for connection while user B tries to establish a connection. After a connection has been established text messages can be exchanged freely between both entities. This script works on your local network, but can be used on an external network if you forward a port to your machine. For more information on port forwarding check out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding
