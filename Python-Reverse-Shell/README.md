# Python-Reverse-Shell
Reverse Shell that works on Windows targets and is written in Python


How the Reverse Shell works: 
The Attacker machine will send commands to the victim machine which will then be executed. The output will be send back to the attacker.


Requirements: 
A Kali Linux machine will be running the server (attacker) script. The client (victim) has to be a Windows PC and will be running the client script.
